== PANOPTIBOT ==

A very simple Jabber (XMPP) and Twitter chat room bot.

At the core it receives messages from participants and echoes the messages to the other participants. It functions pretty much like an IRC channel. It uses the XMPP4r-simple, XMPP4R and Twitter4R libraries.

XMPP Chat Features:
 * Echo messages from one participant to all others.
 * Supports commands like:
     /who     - who is online currently
     /nick    - change your nickname displayed to the other participants
     /quiet   - stop receiving messages temporarily (and /resume)
     /history - show a history of the chat
     /search  - search the history of the chat. 
 
Twitter Chat Features:
 * Post direct messages sent to one account as status messages for that account. If you make that account private, and have your users follow it, they can 'chat' with each other by sending direct messages to the bot account.

Web Features:
 * You can browse the message history.

3. Add yourself to the bot by using ruby script/console (after this you can add user to the bot using the /add command on the bot.)
  $ ruby script/console

  => #<User id: 2, login: "someuser@gmail.com", status: "offline", nick: nil, email: nil ....
  >> exit

4. Run the app.
  $ ruby script/server.

5. Add the bot user as a 'friend' (register for presence notifications) using your IM client. Follow the bot account in twitter.
